## About The Project

This project demonstrates a simple web server created with **Express.js**, a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js. The server responds with a "Hello World" message, showcasing basic Express.js functionality.

## Overview

This project sets up an Express server and responds to a `GET` request at the root URL (`/`). The message displayed is "Hello, World! This message is generated using JavaScript". This serves as an introduction to server-side JavaScript programming with Node.js and Express.js.

## Features
- Simple web server created using **Express.js**
- Responds with a "Hello World" message at the root URL (`/`)
- Easy to set up and run for beginners

## Built With
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for running JavaScript server-side)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node package manager to install dependencies)
